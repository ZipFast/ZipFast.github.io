# Trie

​	Consider we want to search string key, if we store keys in binary search tree, then the time complexity is $O(MlogN)$, M is the average length of the key, and N is the number of the keys. (Because we must search the node and compare the string in the node with the desire key).

​	We can achieve $O(M)$ time by using trie tree.

​	the root of trie is always the blank, 每个节点都包含多个分支，用isEndOfWord来标识词尾的字母。

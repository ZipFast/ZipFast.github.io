# F. Graph Without Long Directed Paths
You are given a connected undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. There are no self-loops or multiple edges in the given graph.

You have to direct its edges in such a way that the obtained directed graph does not contain any paths of length two or greater (where the length of path is denoted as the number of traversed edges).

Input
The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (2≤n≤2⋅105, n−1≤m≤2⋅105) — the number of vertices and edges, respectively.

The following m lines contain edges: edge i is given as a pair of vertices ui, vi (1≤ui,vi≤n, ui≠vi). There are no multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair (ui,vi) there are no other pairs (ui,vi) and (vi,ui) in the list of edges. It is also guaranteed that the given graph is connected (there is a path between any pair of vertex in the given graph).

Output
If it is impossible to direct edges of the given graph in such a way that the obtained directed graph does not contain paths of length at least two, print "NO" in the first line.

Otherwise print "YES" in the first line, and then print any suitable orientation of edges: a binary string (the string consisting only of '0' and '1') of length m. The i-th element of this string should be '0' if the i-th edge of the graph should be directed from ui to vi, and '1' otherwise. Edges are numbered in the order they are given in the input.

大致的意思是给定一个连接的，无向图，能否得到一个不含有大于等于2路径的有向图。

使用二部图的着色算法，如果无向图能够构成一个二部图(两个集合0和1)，那么就可以得到一个所有路径都小于2的有向图，这个有向图的所有边的顶点分属两个不同集合，且方向为从0到1
